# MancalaAI

A program for training and testing networks to play Mancala

## Running MancalaAI

Dependencies:

	Python 3.5 or greater
	OpenAI Gym
	Keras-RL
	Theano

The easiest way to get these dependencies is to simply run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

I've tested MancalaAI on Windows and Ubuntu 16.04 on Ubuntu I also had to install python3-dev

```
sudo apt install python3-dev
```

Once you have the dependencies you can run unit tests or main:

```
python3 __main__.py
python3 unit_tests.py
```
